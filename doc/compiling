			Compiling the Game

Required software:
	make
	cc

Machine-wise configuration

	Determine what kind of machine you're on (sun4, sun3, sequent,
	mipsultrix machine, alpha, etc).

	Type "make" at the high level, and see if your machine is in the
	resulting list.

	If it is not, you will need to edit the high-level Makefile and
	add support for your architecture in.  Send e-mail to:
		"wolfpack@wolfpackempire.com"
	if you need help doing this.

Constructing Binaries

	First, run "make depend" to build the dependencies.  You only need
	to do this once before the first build.  You may run this again if
	you make significant changes to the code (including new files, etc.)

	Second, Run "make <arch>" at the top level.

Installing Info Pages

	The INFO pages aren't run as a part of the normal make session.
	In order to install them, you must cd into the "info" subdirectory,
	and run "make".  This will nroff all the info documents and place
	them in the "../info.nr" directory, from where players can
	access them during the game.

	You will need perl5 installed as your version of perl for this to
	work.

	If you add or change any info pages, then be sure to follow
	the instructions in info/README to generate new Subjects pages.
