			What can I delete?


If disk space is a concern, then there are a number of files which you can
safely delete without affecting your game.

You can type this immediately:
  rm -fr xland old

Once you have compiled your info pages, you can type:
  rm -fr info

Once you have compiled your server, you can type:
  make clean
