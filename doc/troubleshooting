Here are some of the most common problems with solutions.  This file
will probably grow over time.

(Q) I try to log in as POGO, but the server says, "You're not a deity".  Why?

(A) If you get a "You're not a deity!" message and logged off, check the
    "data/server.log" file and look at the end for a "NON-AUTH" entry.
    There should be a "user@host" message in there that failed to log in.
    The user and host that your system is using may be different than the
    one you put in your build.conf file.  So, enter this new user and host
    in the auth file, and you should be able to log into the server as a
    deity now.  Note that if you rebuild the server again, the auth file
    will be overwritten.
