Unicode changes:

1. toggle UTF-8

   Add utf8 as a toggle option and store in the nat_flags field in
   nation structure.  In the future, this should be a login option
   rather than a country toggle once the login options are added.

2. flash and wall

   a. Message as command argument

      Interpret raw command line as message text rather than normal
      text.

   b. Multi-line mode

      Read message lines as message text rather than normal text.

   c. Break long lines

      Count the charactes using utf8 format.  This works for both ASCII
      and UTF8 formatted strings.

   d. Print lines

      Print as message text rather than normal text.

3. Telexes and telex-like things

   a. read and wire, MOTD and gamedown message

      Print as message text rather than normal text.

   c. tele, anno, pray, turn.

      Read as message text rather than normal text.

4. Input filtering

   a. Parsing commands (normal text)

      Ignore control and non-ASCII characters when copying argument
      strings.

   b. Reading normal text command arguments

      Replace control and non-ASCII characters, except for tab with
      "?'.

   c. Reading message text command arguments

      Support message text arguments, used by 3a. and 2b.  Replace
      control and, if NF_UTF8 is off, non-ASCII characters.

5. Output filtering

   Output filtering asssumes that there are no control characters or
   invalid characters in the output messages.  The control characters
   and invalid characters are filtered out during input filtering or
   that the server will not generate control characters or invalid
   characters.

   a. Printing normal text

      When NF_UTF8 is on, highlighted text is printed using SO/SI.

   b. Printing message text

      When NF_UTF8 is off, replace UTF8 charactes with '?'.


Definitions:

1. Normal Text
	For normal text, the following ASCII characters are valid:
	CR, LF and 0x20-0x7e.  Normally, LF is an termination action
	event.	Normally, CR is not used except by the server.
	Normal Text does not support UTF8 characters.  In normal
	text, the 8th bit is used a highlight bit.  If the client
	has the utf8 nation flag set, the standout bit is removed
	and the highlight block is prefixed with SO (ASCII standout)
	and suffixed with SI (ASCII standin).
	
2. Message Text
	For message text, the following ASCII characters are valid:
	Tab, CR, LF and 0x020-0x7e.  Normally, LF is an termination
	action event.	Normally, CR is not used except by the server.
	Message text also supports UTF8 characters if the utf8 nation
	flag is	turn on otherwise only the ASCII characters are
	supported.


Notes:

1. Strings that considered message text are commented.

2. Both Normal and Message text are char strings are in the server.
	Care needs to be taken as some compiler consider char
	signed and other default to unsigned char.

3. Unicode functions are prefixed with u.
