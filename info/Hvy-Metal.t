.TH Concept "Hvy-Metal"
.NA Hvy-Metal "Special rules for Hvy Metal"
.LV Basic
.s1
Ship types are customized.  Better check show for the details.
.s1
Dreadnoughts are more heavily armored.  Frigates are more fragile.
.s1
More ships can carry choppers, and jf2 count as choppers.  Some ships
are not ideal for this, and this is reflected by the lack of large
petrol and shell storage.  But it gives players yet another
interesting avenue to explore, and reflects the ships better.  Also
helps simulate irregular forces desperately equipping what they can for
a role.  A chance for a creative player to spring surprises.
.s1
New assault ship type: Think Tarawa or Io Jima class ships.  These put
the ASSAULT back into landings.  Huge mil capacity, can operate
choppers and Harriers.  Able to drop 12 marine units and a horde of
mil onto a shore, or sustain para drops and air strikes inland with
its aircraft.  Go ashore in a hurry, Big Time.  A fat target too, so
guard it carefully.
.s1
Land unit types are heavily customized.  Better check show for the
details.  Non-mechanized units are slower and more vulnerable,
infantry units have capability security, marines have amtraks,
artilley firing ranges differ, few units are light (but troop
transports and landing ships can carry non-light units), food
capacities are reduced.
.s1
Tanks and AAA can fire.  \*QHey guys, why don't we shoot this big gun
on this tank at those d*mn elves on that hill instead of hanging our
laundry on it\*U?  Don't expect the range of an artillery unit, which
specializes in this and has forward observers built in to the unit
cost.  Watch your magazines too!
.s1
Artillery units with capability heavy can only fire at sectors and
fire offensive support.  They can't target ships, return fire,
interdict, or fire defensive support.
.s1
Artillery units in mountains receive a range bonus of +0.5.
.s1
New experimental option RAILWAYS is enabled: trains run on highways
and sectors next to highways.  Use sinfra to find out mobility costs.
Try sect # ?track>0 to visualize your track.  Check \*Qinfo
Railroad\*U for details.
.s1
There are more train types, BIG siege guns, etc.  And we got the
Mother Of All Guns: something like what was attempted a few times in
history, a huge costly gun with incredible range.  It CAN be moved.
Slowly.  Has all the problems fixed positions have.  If these are not
obvious, any experienced player will gladly demonstrate them for you.
.s1
Infrastructure is disabled.
.s1
New experimental option LIMBER is enabled: slow guns and heavy railway
guns use mobility to unlimber.  Limbering and unlimbering is
completely automatic.  See info \*QUnit-types\*U for details.
.s1
Planes are tweaked somewhat.  show is your friend.
.s1
Che age just like military reserves: 1% decay per 24 ETUs.  In
sufficiently loyal sectors you don't own, however, a full half of them
(rounded up) vanish each update.  The anti command is disabled.
.s1
Mountains, fortresses and cities provide a respectable defensive
bonus.  Cities cost real money to build.  Banks need construction
materials to build efficiency.  Ever seen Fort Knox?  Bridges are
cheaper than usual.
.s1
Food is much harder to grow.  Expect 20% of your population to be
farmers.
.s1
Natural resources gold, oil and uran deplete much slower than usual.
Fully depleting a sector will take you several updates.  Oil
production does not depend on tech; you don't have to micro-manage to
conserve oil.  Resources are scarce.  Expect to fight over them.
.s1
Oil derricks need to set up shop before they produce: no production
while mobility is below maximum.
.s1
New experimental option AUTO_POWER is enabled: the power report is
only updated automatically, at the update.  No more tactical abuse.
.s1
Missed updates due to server problems will be forced if caught within
15 minutes of planned update time or skipped otherwise.
.s1
Everything you do in this game is logged by the deities for their own
nefarious purposes.  However, the logs are treated confidentially.
.s1
Make the deities laugh and get up to 5 gold bars.  5 bars per week up
for grabs.
