.NA Hvy-Plastic "Special rules for Hvy Plastic 2"
.LV Basic
.s1
Ship types are customized.  Better check show for the details.
.s1
Dreadnoughts are more heavily armored.  Frigates are more fragile.
.s1
More ships can carry choppers.  Some ships are not ideal for this, and
this is reflected by the lack of large petrol and shell storage.
.s1
Land unit types are heavily customized.  Better check show for the
details.  Non-mechanized units are slower and more vulnerable,
artillery firing ranges differ, few units are light (but troop
transports and landing ships can carry non-light units).
.s1
Planes are tweaked somewhat.  show is your friend.
.s1
Nukes are on sale, but nuclear plants are not.  Did I mention the show
command?
.s1
Infrastructure is disabled.
.s1
Fortresses cost maintenance, like capitals.
.s1
Your refineries make less petrol from each barrel of oil than usual.
.s1
Natural resources gold, oil and uran deplete much slower than usual.
A 100% gold resource contains 2500d, a 100% oil resource contains
2500o, and a 100% uranium resource contains 500u.  Fully depleting a
sector will take you several updates, and a small fraction of the
resource contents will be lost.
.s1
Gold in mountains does not deplete at all.
.s1
Oil production does not depend on tech; you don't have to micro-manage
to conserve oil.
.s1
Server time is in UTC, which means there will be no daylight savings
time.
.s1
Missed updates due to server problems will be forced if caught within
15 minutes of planned update time or skipped otherwise.
.s1
Everything you do in this game is logged by the deities for their own
nefarious purposes.  However, the logs are treated confidentially.
.s1
Make the deity laugh and get up to 5 gold bars.
