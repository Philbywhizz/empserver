This is the basic Empire Client.

See the "LEGAL", "LICENSE", "CREDITS" and "README" files for all the
related information and legal notices. It is expected that any future
projects/authors will amend these files as needed.

For questions and comments, please contact "wolfpack@wolfpackempire.com".

Note that this client is the same client that is shipped with the
server.  The only difference is the Makefile is copied from the
"Makefile.standalone" for the standalone distributions, and
from the "Makefile.server" for the server distributions.

If you are building this with the server, it is built automatically.

If you are building this standalone, continue reading to see how
to build the client.

To make the program, edit ipglob.c and change empirehost[] to
point at the machine where the game is running (although this is
not necessary.)

Also, if you are going to use "gcc", you need to change the Makefile
line "CC=cc" to "CC=gcc".

To build for a Linux macihne, type "make linux".

To build for a HP/UX machine, type "make hpux".

To build for a DG/UX machine, type "make dgux".

To build for a Solaris machine, type "make solaris".

To build for a Windows machine, type "nmake nt".
  (Note that the Windows port was built with MSVC 6.0)

For other machines, type "make".

You can change hosts on-the-fly by using environment variables -- see
the man page for details.  But, for a short version, you can set the
EMPIREHOST and EMPIREPORT environment variables to the host and
port of the server you wish to connect to, and the client will
automatically use them instead of the built in ones.

Also note that pipes do not work on the Windows versions.
